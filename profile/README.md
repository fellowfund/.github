**FellowFund** is a platform that leverages *prediction market primitives* to transform fellowship selection and accountability in the Web3 ecosystem. By integrating financial stakes into the decision-making process, FellowFund enables ecosystem projectsâ€”such as foundations or DAOs to make more informed and committed fellowship decisions. Builders apply by setting clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and the community uses prediction markets to bet on whether these applicants will meet their performance targets. Applicants who receive over 50% 'YES' stakes are awarded fellowship grants funded by the ecosystem's deposited funds. This mechanism ensures decisions are made with "skin in the game," aligning incentives among ecosystem projects, builders, and the community. By utilizing prediction market mechanisms, FellowFund not only enhances accountability but primarily empowers more effective decision-making, fostering a more engaged and prosperous Web3 ecosystem.
